#Saim, an ImageJ/Fiji plugin
Saim is short for Scanning Angle Interference Microscopy.  It is a fluorescence microscope technique used 
to measure height differences with nanometer resolution.  The following publication describes it in full:  
Paszek, M.J., DuFort, C.C., Rubashkin, M.G., Davidson, M.W., Thorn, K.S., Liphardt, J.T., and Weaver, V.M. (2012). 
Scanning angle interference microscopy reveals cell dynamics at the nanoscale. Nat Meth 9, 825â€“827.

The code in this repository is for an ImageJ/Fiji plugin to perform the analysis described in Matt's paper.  A manual for the use of this plugin can be found on the [ImageJ2 website](http://imagej.net/Saim).   

This project is also described in: Carbone, C. B., Vale, R. D., & Stuurman, N. (2016). An acquisition and analysis pipeline for scanning angle interference microscopy. Nat Meth, 13(11), 897â€“898. [doi:10.1038/nmeth.4030] (http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4030).

Like other ImageJ plugins, the code for the plugin is written in Java.  To build it, use [maven](https://maven.apache.org) or any Java IDE that works with maven projects.

The easiest way to use this plugin is to install [Fiji](http://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads) and activate the ValeLabUtils update site (Help > Update Fiji > Manage update sites).
